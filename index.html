<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started in high school during our mandatory IT classes, learning those IT basics really peaked my interests and had me wanting to learn more. After which I joined our schools Robotics club and that really sparked my interest in programming and robotics. 
My experience in IT is limited to my current job, I work with some complicated applications that were designed for our company. They have a lot of technical issues, especially after updates, and require constant maintenance. As a SuperUser its part of my job to keep up to date on issues and develop interim solutions until national can fix the problem.</p>

<p>I chose RMIT through Open Universities Australia because it gave me the most flexibility in terms of studying online and what direction I wanted to take in my degree. As I have very limited experience in IT to date I wanted to get all the fundamentals down before I picked what specialty to do.</p>

<p>I am aiming to learn some strong IT basics across a few areas, and then to pick something I enjoy or excel in as a specialty to continue studying. As I am not 100% sure what direction I would like to take my studies in, I am open to exploring all different area of IT.</p>

<p>From the list provided this job requires experiences in various software development, and web development applications/ programs such as; C#, ASP.net, HTML, CSS, Javascript and unit testing. To be effective in this role an applicant would also need to have strong written and verbal skills, and the capability to communicate with people of all skills levels, both technical and non-technical.</p>
<p>	Right now my skills in the area of software development are minimal, having very limited opportunities and experiences to accrue these. I do however believe that I have the written and verbal skills necessary for a role of this type and am also seasoned in training users of all skill levels in my current working environment.</p>
