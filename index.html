<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>Name: Ashton Rosser</p>
<p>Student number: s3806781</p>
<p>Email: s3806781@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started in high school during our mandatory IT classes, learning those IT basics really peaked my interests and had me wanting to learn more. After which I joined our schools Robotics club and that really sparked my interest in programming and robotics. 
My experience in IT is limited to my current job, I work with some complicated applications that were designed for our company. They have a lot of technical issues, especially after updates, and require constant maintenance. As a SuperUser its part of my job to keep up to date on issues and develop interim solutions until national can fix the problem.</p>

<p>I chose RMIT through Open Universities Australia because it gave me the most flexibility in terms of studying online and what direction I wanted to take in my degree. As I have very limited experience in IT to date I wanted to get all the fundamentals down before I picked what specialty to do.</p>

<p>I am aiming to learn some strong IT basics across a few areas, and then to pick something I enjoy or excel in as a specialty to continue studying. As I am not 100% sure what direction I would like to take my studies in, I am open to exploring all different area of IT.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  
<p>The job advert I have chosen is a software developer for Sigma Bravo, the job is to work as a contractor for the military supporting their Defence systems. From the advert it appears the job entails software design, support and development. As well as being responsible for training the users in how to use the software effectively.<p/>

<p>From the list provided this job requires experiences in various software development, and web development applications/ programs such as; C#, ASP.net, HTML, CSS, Javascript and unit testing. To be effective in this role an applicant would also need to have strong written and verbal skills, and the capability to communicate with people of all skills levels, both technical and non-technical.</p>
<p>Right now my skills in the area of software development are minimal, having very limited opportunities and experiences to accrue these. I do however believe that I have the written and verbal skills necessary for a role of this type and am also seasoned in training users of all skill levels in my current working environment.</p>

<p>The first part of my plan is to work and complete my degree through RMIT, this should give me a sound knowledge of a few different areas of IT and then pick an area, such as software development if that is still what I am aiming for at the time, to specialize in. I also have my eye on a few short courses leaning how to use different applications/ programs such as C# and Python, that I intend to complete when time allows.</p>

<p>The above results give me some great insights into my personal behaviors which I have enjoyed expanding my learning about. The Myer-Briggs test results gave me the Advocate result, which highlighted very accurately the positive and negative sides of my personality, and opened my eyes to some fundamental truths about my life. The learning style test I chose gave me the dominantly visual learning style, which I was aware it of but did offer me some good material to assist my learning. Lastly the Big Five Personality test went very in depth into 30 sections of their five main personality attributes, which through reading clearly highlighted a lot of areas of improvement for myself that I intend to work on.</p>
<p>Reading and learning about the results of all these tests have made me more mindful of what kind of working behavior I have, and I am hoping this will assist me in working in a team going forward. Using these results will give me some better awareness into how I work as an individual in a team, and I intend to use this to achieve a greater working relationship in a team environment.</p>
<p>Given the opportunity forming a team with people with personality types that work well together would be ideal, such as an ENFP type to go with my INFJ type. I would also choose others with different learning styles, as each learning style can gather different bits of information and interpret them differently, having multiple types would compliment each other and create a better all round knowledge.</p>
  
<h2>Project Idea</h2>
  
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The thing I have always been the most passionate about is my animals, and I have had many different types of animals over the years, often many at a time, so much that it was difficult to keep track of all their needs. I have tried calendars, reminders and even a few smartphone applications made for the purpose of tracking your pets health, however I found that all were lacking something and were too clunky or too difficult to use. But what if there was a smartphone application that could assist you in managing all your pets needs? Well that’s what I aim to do.</p>  
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>My motivation for this project is simply to make parts of an animal’s owners life less stressful. With this application there would be no need to stress over when your animals’ health or managing an animal’s needs. This application would serve useful not just for the everyday pet owner but also for people with large properties with dozens or hundreds of animals. As of 2017 more than 62% of Australian households have pets, and with there being more than 85, 000 farms Australia wide there is certainly a market for the technology to better manage our furry friends.</p>  
<h3>Description</h3>   
<p>The smartphone application I am looking to design has a range of features, it will include 5 tabs as shown in the concept art, which would be designed to provide the following features.</p>
  <h4>Animals</h4><p>This tab is to log each animals individual profile, including; breed, weight, dietary restrictions, injection dates, vet check ups dates and any other medical or non medical related issues that need monitoring. As this is designed not just for regular pet owners but also for any large scale farming, there is also the option to add animals as a larger quantity, such as a heard of sheep, that would require their sheering or medical check ups to be done at the same time.</p>
  <h4>Calendar</h4><p>The calendar tab is where all created events/ reminders will appear in an easy to view layout, appearing just as a regular calendar, with the ability to categorize each animal/ or group of animals by colours for easy viewing.</p>
  <h4>Events</h4><p>The events tab is where to go to add an upcoming event, such as a vet appointment. This will have the ability to set reminders to warn of upcoming events, to add notes specific to each event, as well as input the location for each event, with the option to remind at location.</p>
  <h4>Manage</h4><p>The manage tab has the ability to store all necessary data on any service/ product related to our pets lives, including veterinary records (eg medical records, vaccination dates). Such as adding contacts, like vets, dog groomers, or a daycare. There will also be the option to add specific foods, for example if your cat has special diet restrictions meaning they need to eat a certain brand of pet food. Toys or other products can also be added here, as recommended care information about your animals/ breeds that would be beneficial to managing them.</p>
  <h4>Care</h4><p>The care tab would be used to provide recommended care advice for profiled pets/ animals, which would be catered to the species and breed of animal so the best possible advice could be provided. Some examples of recommended care would be diet, ideal weights, average exercise per day, training assistance and Frequently asked questions (to assist in answering the most common queries among todays pet owners).</p>
<p>While I do believe that there is a market for this type of application I can also recognize that there would be difficulties to face rolling it out. As I mentioned previously there are other smartphone applications out there that have some features of the same kind, and while none exist will the total package of features and usability there would still be competition in the market due to other versions being available for use. Another potential hurdle would be sourcing care recommendations for specific animals/ breeds, most importantly animals I have no experience with. An agreement would have to be reached with an organization or company that was able to provide, and continue to update this information, so that the user would be able to gain the most out of the applications services.</p>
