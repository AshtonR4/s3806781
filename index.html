  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started in high school during our mandatory IT classes, learning those IT basics really peaked my interests and had me wanting to learn more. After which I joined our schools Robotics club and that really sparked my interest in programming and robotics. 
My experience in IT is limited to my current job, I work with some complicated applications that were designed for our company. They have a lot of technical issues, especially after updates, and require constant maintenance. As a SuperUser its part of my job to keep up to date on issues and develop interim solutions until national can fix the problem.</p>

<p>	I chose RMIT through Open Universities Australia because it gave me the most flexibility in terms of studying online and what direction I wanted to take in my degree. As I have very limited experience in IT to date I wanted to get all the fundamentals down before I picked what specialty to do. </p>

<p>	I am aiming to learn some strong IT basics across a few areas, and then to pick something I enjoy or excel in as a specialty to continue studying. As I am not 100% sure what direction I would like to take my studies in, I am open to exploring all different area of IT.</p>
